I started with Arduinos, and unexpectedly ended up smashing stacks and uploading malicious PHP on clients' websites. But meantime, I worked with sequencial function charts, MODBUS, electronics boards, and all the stuff that goes _bip boop_ and unexpectedly overheats.

Since I tried a Linux machine, I never went back. But I don't hate Windows though, it can be really handy to deploy vulnerable labs to play with.

I also had the chance to learn and develop open-source projects in Golang, from low-level stuff to k8s-ready softwares. I'm also comfortable with Docker, C, can write a little bit of Python, and have a decent knowledge of x86_64 architectures, gdb, and assembly. Because as the saying goes, every software is open-source if you can read machine code. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
